# Hey! I'm Pallavi 👩‍💻


After years of working across data engineering and machine learning, I’ve come to love turning raw data into meaningful insights and scalable solutions. From building real-time ETL pipelines to deploying predictive models with AutoML, I bring a blend of technical depth and business context to data challenges.
